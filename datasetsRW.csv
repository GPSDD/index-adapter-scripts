Specifically, a region must meet the following criteria to achieve Conservation International’s hotspot classification: 1) At least 1,500 species of vascular plants (>0.5% of the world’s total) are endemic; 2) At least 70% of the original natural vegetation has been lost. When Myers first defined the term, he identified 10 tropical forest hotspots. The need to pinpoint priority conservation regions led Conservation International (CI) to adopt the term and reassess the hotspot concept. In this process, CI introduced quantitative thresholds (see above) and added additional regions. At that time, there were 25 hotspots. Because of the constant change in environmental threats and the improved understanding of biodiversity, CI has since revisited the hotspots to refine boundaries, update information, and add new regions to create this global data set. This process produced an additional 10 hotspots, bringing the total to 35. PREPdata shows only a subset of this data set.

The first version of the Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios (ICLUS) project modeled population, residential development, and impervious surface cover changes by decade to the year 2100. Those modeling choices and assumptions were intended to be consistent with four scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). ICLUS version 2 is designed to be consistent with a more recent IPCC scenarios framework, drawing from two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Improvements include the use of updated input data, integration of changing climate variables within the migration model, inclusion transportation network capacity and increase over time, growth in commercial and industrial land uses, and the use of population density-driven demands for residential housing, as well as commercial and industrial development. ICLUS v2.1 consists of population and land use projections produced specifically to support the Fourth National Climate Assessment. The methodology used to produce these population projections differs from ICLUS v2.0. The demographic components of change (i.e., rates of fertility and mortality) for ICLUS v2.1 were taken directly from the Wittgenstein Centre Data Explorer (http://witt.null2.net/shiny/wic/). These projections were produced much more recently than the Census projections used in ICLUS v2.0, and incorporate more recent observations of population change. SSP2 is a “middle-of-the-road” projection, where social, economic and technological trends do not shift markedly from historical patterns, resulting in a U.S. population of 455 million people by 2100. Domestic migration trends remain consistent with the recent past. The SSP5 narrative describes a rapidly growing and flourishing global economy that remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, and a U.S. population that exceeds 730 million by 2100. ICLUS v2.1 land use projections under SSP5 result in a considerably larger expansion of developed lands relative to SSP2. Note that some versions of ICLUS projections do not include climate change projections to dynamically update location-specific amenities when calculating migration. These projections will include the “nocc” label in the file name to indicate this difference. PREPdata shows only a subset of this data set.

The CA-BCM 2014 applies a monthly regional water-balance model to simulate hydrologic responses to climate at the spatial resolution of a 270-m grid. The model has been calibrated using a total of 159 relatively unimpaired watersheds for the California region. The historical data is based on 800m PRISM data spatially downscaled to 270 m using the gradient-inverse distance squared approach (GIDS), and the projected climate surfaces include five CMIP-3 and nine CMIP-5 General Circulation Models under a range of emission scenarios or representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for a total of 18 futures that have been statistically downscaled using BCSD to 800 m and further downscaled using GIDS to 270 m for model application. The BCM approach uses a regional water balance model based on this high resolution precipitation and temperature as well as elevation, geology, and soils to produce surfaces for the following variables: precipitation, air temperature, April 1st snowpack, recharge, runoff, potential evapotranspiration (PET), actual evapotranspiration, and climatic water deficit, a parameter that is calculated as PET minus actual evapotranspiration. The revised modeling for the CA-BCM described in Flint et al. 2013, referenced below, includes the updated 800-m spatial resolution climate data from PRISM, the county level soils data (SSURGO) for the entire state, and more rigorous snow and PET calibrations for California. This dataset included updates to all the basin calibrations as well. The future climate projections included the original 4 projections that were revised with bias-corrections to the 800-m historical PRISM climate, plus an additional 3 projections from the CMIP3 dataset (IPCC 4th Assessment Report) and 11 projections from the CMIP5 datasets (IPCC 5th Assessment Report). These projections included a range of emissions scenarios and representative concentration pathways.

NEXRAD stations use the Weather Surveillance Radar - 1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) system. This is a 10 cm wavelength (S-Band) radar that operates at a frequency between 2,700 and 3,000 MHz. The radar system operates in two basic modes: a slow-scanning Clear Air Mode (Mode B) for analyzing air movements when there is little or no precipitation activity in the area, and a Precipitation Mode (Mode A) with a faster scan for tracking active weather. The two modes employ nine Volume Coverage Patterns (VCPs) to adequately sample the atmosphere based on weather conditions. A VCP is a series of 360 degree sweeps of the antenna at pre-determined elevation angles and pulse repetition frequencies completed in a specified period of time. The radar scan times 4.5, 5, 6 or 10 minutes depending on the selected VCP. During 2008, the WSR-88D radars were upgraded to produce increased spatial resolution data, called Super Resolution. The earlier Legacy Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 1 km range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 1.0 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 230 km. The upgraded Super Resolution data provides radar reflectivity at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 460 km, and Doppler velocity and spectrum width at 0.5 degree azimuthal by 250 m range gate resolution to a range of 300 km. Super resolution makes a compromise of slightly decreased noise reduction for a large gain in resolution. In 2010, the deployment of the Dual Polarization (Dual Pol) capability to NEXRAD sites began with the first operational Dual Pol radar in May 2011. Dual Pol radar capability adds vertical polarization to the previous horizontal radar waves, in order to more accurately discern the return signal. This allows the radar to better distinguish between types of precipitation (e.g., rain, hail and snow), improves rainfall estimates, improves data retrieval in mountainous terrain, and aids in removal of non-weather artifacts. The NEXRAD products are divided in two data processing levels. The lower Level II data are base products at original resolution. Level II data are recorded at all NWS and most USAF and FAA WSR-88D sites. From the Level II quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis Level III products. The Level III data consists of reduced resolution, low-bandwidth, base products as well as many derived, post-processed products. Level III products are recorded at most U.S. sites, though non-US sites do not have Level III products. There are over 40 Level III products available from the NCDC. General products for Level III include the base and composite reflectivity, storm relative velocity, vertical integrated liquid, echo tops and VAD wind profile. Precipitation products for Level III include estimated ground accumulated rainfall amounts for one and three hour periods, storm totals, and digital arrays. Estimates are based on reflectivity to rainfall rate (Z-R) relationships. Overlay products for Level III are alphanumeric data that give detailed information on certain parameters for an identified storm cell. These include storm structure, hail index, mesocyclone identification, tornadic vortex signature, and storm tracking information. Radar messages for Level III are sent by the radar site to users in order to know more about the radar status and special product data. NEXRAD data are provided to the NOAA National Climatic Data Center for archiving and dissemination to users. Data coverage varies by station and ranges from May 1992 to 1 day from present. Most stations began observing in the mid-1990s, and most period of records are continuous.",https://www.prepdata.org/dataset/0b9e546c-f42a-4b26-bad3-7d606f58961c

On the global scale, climate model simulations show consistent projections of future annual precipitation conditions under a range of emissions scenarios. Models are in complete agreement in showing decreases in annual precipitation in the subtropics and increases in annual precipitation at higher latitudes. The contiguous U.S. straddles the transition zone between drier conditions in the subtropics (south) and wetter conditions at higher latitudes (north). Because the precise location of this zone varies somewhat among models, projected changes in annual precipitation in central areas of the U.S. range from small increases to small decreases. A clear direction of annual precipitation change occurs only in Alaska and the far north of the contiguous U.S. where increases are projected, and in the far Southwest where decreases are projected. Although this means that changes in overall precipitation are uncertain in many U.S. areas, there is a high degree of certainty that the heaviest precipitation events will increase everywhere, and by large amounts. This consistent model projection is well understood and is a direct outcome of the increase in atmospheric moisture caused by warming. There is also more certainty regarding dry spells. The annual maximum number of consecutive dry days is projected to increase in most areas, especially the southern and northwestern portions of the contiguous United States.

See: http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/regions/great-plains#graphic-16883 This figure shows the average of projections of the number of heavy precipitation days from several climate models. On the global scale, climate model simulations show consistent projections of future annual precipitation conditions under a range of emissions scenarios. Models are in complete agreement in showing decreases in annual precipitation in the subtropics and increases in annual precipitation at higher latitudes. The contiguous U.S. straddles the transition zone between drier conditions in the subtropics (south) and wetter conditions at higher latitudes (north). Because the precise location of this zone varies somewhat among models, projected changes in annual precipitation in central areas of the U.S. range from small increases to small decreases. A clear direction of annual precipitation change occurs only in Alaska and the far north of the contiguous U.S. where increases are projected, and in the far Southwest where decreases are projected. Although this means that changes in overall precipitation are uncertain in many U.S. areas, there is a high degree of certainty that the number of heavy precipitation events will increase almost everywhere. This consistent model projection is well understood and is a direct outcome of the increase in atmospheric moisture caused by warming.

The CCI Land Cover project delivers consistent global land cover maps at 300 m spatial resolution on an annual basis from 1992 to 2015. To ensure consistency from year to year, land cover maps for each year are derived from a single baseline land cover map. The baseline map was created using the full record of MERIS images from 2003 to 2012, using unsupervised classification as well as a machine learning algorithm over multiple years of imagery. Changes are then detected between individual years at 1 km resolution, using AVHRR data from 1992 to 1999, SPOT-VGT data from 1999 to 2013, and PROVA-V data from 2014 and 2015. Changes must be consistent for two consecutive years in order to be counted, with the exception of forest changes in 2014 and 2015 which are assumed to be well detected. The 1 km changes are then combined with the baseline land cover map and delineated to 300 meters for 2004 onward (when MERIS and PROVA-V data are available). The resulting data have a total of 22 global land cover classes.

The National Wetlands Inventory - Version 2, Surface Waters and Wetlands Inventory was derived by retaining the wetland and deepwater polygons that compose the NWI digital wetlands spatial data layer and reintroducing any linear wetland or surface water features that were orphaned from the original NWI hard copy maps by converting them to narrow polygonal features. Additionally, the data are supplemented with hydrography data, buffered to become polygonal features, as a secondary source for any single-line stream features not mapped by the NWI and to complete segmented connections. Wetland mapping conducted in WA, OR, CA, NV and ID after 2012 and most other projects mapped after 2015 were mapped to include all surface water features and are not derived data. The linear hydrography data set used to derive Version 2 was the U.S. Geological Survey's National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Specific information on the NHD version used to derive Version 2 and where Version 2 was mapped can be found in the 'comments' field of the Wetlands_Project_Metadata feature class. Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps. This data set should be used in conjunction with the Wetlands_Project_Metadata layer, which contains project specific wetlands mapping procedures and information on dates, scales and emulsion of imagery used to map the wetlands within specific project boundaries.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD 2011) is the most recent national land cover product created by the MRLC Consortium. NLCD 2011 provides - for the first time - the capability to assess wall-to-wall, spatially explicit, national land cover changes and trends across the United States from 2001 to 2011. As with two previous NLCD land cover products NLCD 2011 keeps the same 16-class land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across the United States at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2011 is based primarily on a decision-tree classification of circa 2011 Landsat satellite data. National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD 2006) is a 16-class land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across the conterminous United States at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2006 is based primarily on a decision-tree classification of circa 2006 Landsat satellite data. NLCD 2006 also quantifies land cover change between the years 2001 to 2006. The NLCD2006 land cover change product was generated by comparing spectral characteristics of Landsat imagery between 2001 and 2006, on an individual path/row basis, using protocols to identify and label change based on the trajectory from NLCD 2001 products. National Land Cover Database 2001 (NLCD 2001) is a 16-class (additional four classes in Alaska only) land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across all 50 United States and Puerto Rico at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD 2001 is based primarily on a decision-tree classification of circa 2001 Landsat satellite data. NLCD 2001 improves on NLCD92 in that it is comprised of three different elements: land cover, percent developed impervious surface and percent tree canopy density. National Land Cover Dataset 1992 (NLCD1992) is a 21-class land cover classification scheme that has been applied consistently across the lower 48 United States at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. NLCD92 is based primarily on the unsupervised classification of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) circa 1990's satellite data. Other ancillary data sources used to generate these data included topography, census, and agricultural statistics, soil characteristics, and other types of land cover and wetland maps. NLCD1992 is the only NLCD data set that can be downloaded by state and by user defined area from the MRLC Consortium Viewer. NOTE: NLCD 1992 is not recommended for direct comparisons with any subsequent NLCD data products (i.e. NLCD 2001, NLCD 2006, NLCD 2011). The typical result of direct comparison will result in a change map showing differences between legends and mapping methods rather than real changes on the ground.

To meet this need we developed a map that we call wildfire hazard potential (WHP) – a raster geospatial product that can help to inform evaluations of wildfire risk or prioritization of fuels management needs across very large spatial scales (millions of acres). Our specific objective with the WHP map was to depict the relative potential for wildfire that would be difficult for suppression resources to contain. To create the 2014 version, we built upon spatial estimates of wildfire likelihood and intensity generated in 2014 with the Large Fire Simulation system (FSim) for the national interagency Fire Program Analysis system (FPA), as well as spatial fuels and vegetation data from LANDFIRE 2010 and point locations of fire occurrence from FPA (ca. 1992 – 2012). With these data sets as inputs, we produced an index of WHP for all of the conterminous United States at 270 m resolution. We present the final WHP map in two forms: 1) continuous integer values, and 2) five WHP classes of very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. On its own, WHP is not an explicit map of wildfire threat or risk, but when paired with spatial data depicting highly valued resources and assets such as structures or powerlines, it can approximate relative wildfire risk to those specific resources and assets. WHP is also not a forecast or wildfire outlook for any particular season, as it does not include any information on current or forecasted weather or fuel moisture conditions. It is instead intended for long-term strategic fuels management. PREPdata shows only a subset of this data set.

A primary goal of the MRLC Consortium is to generate current, consistent, and seamless national datasets of land cover, percent developed imperviousness, and percent tree canopy. NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was created by partitioning the conterminous United States into 66 mapping zones, based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features, and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. NLCD 2001 represents a seamless assembly of percent developed imperviousness for all 66 MRLC mapping zones. NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was developed for all 50 states and Puerto Rico / U.S. Virgin Islands. NLCD 2006 percent developed imperviousness was created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. NLCD 2006 percent developed imperviousness was developed for the conterminous United States.

NLCD 2001 Percent Tree Canopy was developed in three key steps: 1. Reference data of tree canopy density was derived from the high spatial resolution images. 2. Density prediction models were calibrated using reference data and Landsat spectral bands. 3. The models developed in step 2 were extrapolated spatially to map per-pixel tree canopy density. This method is described in detail in Huang et al. (2001). NLCD 2011 Percent Tree Canopy Cartographic is the cartographic version of the NLCD 2011 Percent Tree Canopy Analytical dataset for the 48 conterminous states.

See: http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/regions/southeast#graphic-17055 This figure shows the average of projections of the number of days over 95 degrees Fahrenheit from several climate models. On the global scale, climate model simulations show consistent projections of future temperature conditions under a range of emissions scenarios. All models show warming by late this century that is much larger than historical variations nearly everywhere globally. For the U.S., models unequivocally project large and historically unprecedented future warming in every region of the U.S. under all of the scenarios used in this assessment. The amount of warming varies substantially between higher versus lower scenarios, and moderately from model to model, but the amount of projected warming is much larger than historical variations. Likewise, the models project unequivocal increases in the number of days over 95 degrees Fahrenheit that are larger than historical variations.

LOCA is a technique for downscaling climate model projections of the future climate. The method estimates finer-scale climate detail using the systematic historical effects of topography on local weather patterns. The LOCA downscaled climate projections provide temperature and precipitation on pixels that are six kilometers (3.7 miles) across. The data are daily, covering the period 1950-2100 for 32 global climate models. LOCA attempts to better preserve extreme hot days and heavy rain events than the previous generation of downscaling approaches. While previous downscaling techniques typically formed the downscaled model day using a weighted average of 30 similar historical days, LOCA looks locally around each point of interest to find the one best matching day. The data spans from Mexico through southern Canada and can be used to assess climate impacts across much of North America, including the entire conterminous U.S. The work represents a collaboration across many groups, including SIO, the California Energy Commission, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Reclamation, the NOAA Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) program, the Climate Analytics Group, the nonprofit group Climate Central, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, NASA Ames Research Center, Santa Clara University, the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder, and the Southwest Climate Science Center.

It was created using data from the UN Environment Programme and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre and compiled by World Resources Institute. Terrestrial protected areas are defined in this instance as ""totally or partially protected areas of at least 1,000 hectares that are designated by national authorities as scientific reserves with limited public access, national parks, natural monuments, nature reserves or wildlife sanctuaries, protected landscapes, and areas managed mainly for sustainable use."" Marine areas, unclassified areas, littoral (intertidal) areas, and sites protected under local or provincial law are excluded. Some sites are owned and managed by governments, others by private individuals, companies, communities, and faith groups. Currently about a 10th of the world's land surface is under some form of protected area, and the system represents a unique commitment to the future. Over the last 40 years the global protected area estate has increased from an area the size of the United Kingdom to an area the size of South America. Increasing the proportion of terrestrial and marine areas protected helps defend vulnerable plant and animal species and safeguard biodiversity. This indicator is calculated using all the nationally designated protected areas recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) whose location and extent is known and aggregated using a weighted average. A global protected area layer is created by combining the polygons and points recorded in the WDPA. Circular buffers are created around points based on the known extent of protected areas for which no polygon is available. Annual protected area layers are created by dissolving the global protected area layer by the known year of establishment of protected areas recorded in the WDPA. The annual protected area layers are overlaid with country/territory boundaries, coastlines, and buffered coastlines (delineating the territorial waters) to obtain the absolute coverage (in km2) of protected areas by country/territory per year from 1990 to the present. The total area of a country's/territory's terrestrial protected areas and marine protected areas in territorial waters is divided by the total area of its land areas (including inland waters) and territorial waters to obtain the relative coverage (percentage) of protected areas.

It shows levels of methane emissions that are being emitted into the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic sources for North America and the rest of the world. CarbonTracker-CH4 emission estimates are consistent with observed patterns of CH4 in the atmosphere. Warm colors show high atmospheric concentrations of CH4, and cool colors show low concentrations. Methane plays an important role in the chemistry and radiative properties of the atmosphere. With a global warming potential of 28 over a 100-year horizon, methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Atmospheric methane has a lifetime of about a decade, and it is ultimately oxidized to CO₂. It is one of the greenhouse gases targeted by the Kyoto Protocol. Controlling methane emissions also has implications for air quality, since oxidation of CH4 leads to tropospheric ozone formation in polluted environments. The CarbonTracker-CH4 uses measurements of air samples collected at surface sites in the NOAA ESRL Cooperative Global Air Sampling Network, except those identified as having analysis or sampling problems or those thought to be influenced by local sources. The sites for which data are available thus vary each week depending on successful sampling and analysis, as well as each site's sampling frequency.

This alert indicates when prices of key staple food commodities have deviated from seasonal trends, and by how much. Early detection of food price increases can alert the international community to the possibility of current and future food insecurity in a region. Seasonal price trends are determined through reference to monthly commodity prices recorded in the WFP's Food and Commodity Price Database, which is collected by WFP country offices, national government agencies, and partner organizations. A linear regression is used to determine the contributions that 2 components make to seasonal price trends: the month of the year (related to harvest times) and the overall passage of time (related to population growth, inflation rates, etc.). The current ALPS value for a food commodity is the number of standard deviations the current price is above the commodity's expected price for that month. Based on this ALPS value, markets are assigned to 1 of 4 situations, where all nominal values are measured in standard deviations from the seasonal mean price: Normal, ALPS < 0.25 Stress, 0.25 < ALPS < 1 Alert, 1 < ALPS < 2 Crisis, ALPS >= 2 Resource Watch shows only a subset of the dataset.

A port with a high inbound score can be interpreted as being a good collection point for global goods, and a port with a high outbound score can be interpreted as being a good distribution point for global goods. This index is the result of research performed at the Georgia Tech Panama Logistics Innovation and Research Center, Chulalongkorn University Department of Industrial Engineering, and University of Hull Logistics Institute. The Container Port Connectivity Index measures the trade connectivity of ports within the network of container shipping and is broken down into an inbound and outbound index. The data on Resource Watch represent both the inbound and outbound indices of global container ports, calculated using container ship scheduled services for the month of September 2017. The CPCI is based on a network representation of container ports, where nodes in network represent individual ports and connections between nodes are weighted based on measures defined by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI). This study uses the same 5 statistics as the LSCI, but on a port-to-port scale instead of the country-world scale of the LSCI: the number of shipping liner services calling between 2 ports, the number of companies providing those services, the number of ships in those services, the combined container capacity of those ships, and the capacity of the largest ship in service. The Hyperlink-Induced-Topic-Search (HITS) algorithm is used to calculate the inbound- and outbound-connectivity of all ports in this network. Concepts of economics are captured by the LSCI measures included in the weights of the network, and network topology is captured by the application of the HITS algorithm to assign inbound- and outbound-connectivity scores.

This alert indicates when prices of key staple food commodities have deviated from seasonal trends, and by how much. Early detection of food price increases can alert the international community to the possibility of current and future food insecurity in a region. Seasonal price trends are determined through reference to monthly commodity prices recorded in the WFP's Food and Commodity Price Database, which is collected by WFP country offices, national government agencies, and partner organizations. A linear regression is used to determine the contributions that 2 components make to seasonal price trends: the month of the year (related to harvest times) and the overall passage of time (related to population growth, inflation rates, etc.). The current ALPS value for a food commodity is the number of standard deviations the current price is above the commodity's expected price for that month. Based on this ALPS value, markets are assigned to 1 of 4 situations, where all nominal values are measured in standard deviations from the seasonal mean price: 1) Normal: ALPS < 0.25; 2) Stress: 0.25 < ALPS < 1; 3) Alert: 1 < ALPS < 2; 4) Crisis: ALPS >= 2.

It is calculated for 24 indicators across 5 dimensions: Political (Regime Type, Lack of Democracy, Government Effectiveness, Level of Repression, Empowerment Rights), Security (Recent Internal Conflict, Neighbors with Highly Violent Conflict, Years since Highly Violent Conflict), Social (Corruption, Ethnic Power Change, Ethnic Compilation, Transnational Ethnic Bonds, Homicide Rate, Infant Mortality), Economy (GDP per Capita, Income Inequality, Openness, Food Security, Unemployment), and Geography and Environment (Water Stress, Oil Production, Structural Constraints, Population Size, Youth Bulge). The GCRI uses a linear regression model including historical data to train the model. Its creators at the JRC first determined the predictive value of the 24 variables regarding conflict onsets in the past 20 years and then applied the results to our final model and derived the weights for our indicators from their significance regarding the model performance.

The ILO classifies economic activity using the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) of All Economic Activities. Because this classification is based on where work is performed (industry) rather than type of work performed (occupation), all of an enterprise's employees are classified under the same industry, regardless of their trade or occupation. Employment is defined as persons of working age who were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit, whether at work during the reference period or not at work due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangement. The agriculture sector consists of activities in agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing.

In the textbook case of economic development, labour flows from agriculture and other labour-intensive primary activities to industry and finally to the services sector; in the process, workers migrate from rural to urban areas. The series is part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific factors.

The values shown are midyear estimates. Population estimates are usually based on national population censuses. Estimates for the years before and after the census are interpolations or extrapolations based on demographic models. Errors and undercounting occur even in high-income countries. In developing countries errors may be substantial because of limits in the transport, communications, and other resources required to conduct and analyze a full census. The quality and reliability of official demographic data are also affected by public trust in the government, government commitment to full and accurate enumeration, confidentiality and protection against misuse of census data, and census agencies' independence from political influence. Moreover, comparability of population indicators is limited by differences in the concepts, definitions, collection procedures, and estimation methods used by national statistical agencies and other organizations that collect the data. The currentness of a census and the availability of complementary data from surveys or registration systems are objective ways to judge demographic data quality. Some European countries' registration systems offer complete information on population in the absence of a census. The United Nations Statistics Division monitors the completeness of vital registration systems. Some developing countries have made progress over the last 60 years, but others still have deficiencies in civil registration systems. International migration is the only other factor besides birth and death rates that directly determines a country's population growth. Estimating migration is difficult. At any time many people are located outside their home country as tourists, workers, or refugees or for other reasons. Standards for the duration and purpose of international moves that qualify as migration vary, and estimates require information on flows into and out of countries that is difficult to collect.

The HydroLAKES database was designed as a digital map repository to include all lakes with a surface area of at least 10 ha. The current version comprises the shoreline polygons of 1,427,688 individual lakes. HydroLAKES aims to be as comprehensive and consistent as possible at a global scale and contains both freshwater and saline lakes, including the Caspian Sea, as well as human-made reservoirs and regulated lakes. The HydroLAKES database was created by compiling, correcting, and unifying several near-global and regional data sets. Map generalization methods were applied and some polygon outlines were smoothed during the mapping process to ensure spatial consistency of the data. The resulting map scale is estimated to be between 1:100,000 and 1:250,000 for most lakes globally, with some coarser ones at 1:1 million. To enhance the attribute information provided by HydroLAKES, a spatial coregistration to the global river network database HydroSHEDS was established. Literature estimates of lake depths and/or volumes were compiled for all lakes ≥ 500 km2. To predict average lake depths and volumes for smaller lakes, a geostatistical model based on surrounding land surface topography was developed. The addition of high-resolution discharge data allowed the estimation of hydraulic residence times for each lake. All natural lakes of the HydroLAKES database show a combined surface area of 2.67 x 106 km2 (1.8% of global land area), a total shoreline length of 7.2 x 106 km (about 4 times longer than the world’s ocean coastline), and a total volume of 181.9 x 103 km3 (0.8% of total global nonfrozen terrestrial water stocks).

These data were compiled using a literature search conducted by Dr. Robert Diaz of VIMS and WRI staff. Three types of status were recorded: 1) Hypoxic: Areas with scientiﬁc evidence that hypoxia was caused, at least in part, by nutrient overenrichment; 2) Eutrophic: Systems that exhibit effects of eutrophication, such as elevated nutrient levels, elevated chlorophyll a levels, harmful algal blooms, changes in the benthic community, damage to coral reefs, and ﬁsh kills.

These data are used as the core of NOAA's CRW coral bleaching management program. These coral bleaching alerts are derived from the NOAA National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS) 5 km Geo-Polar Blended Night-Only SST Analysis. The Bleaching Alert Areas identifies locations where bleaching heat stress reaches various risk levels based on the HotSpot and DHW values. HotSpot is a positive-only anomaly registering the departure of satellite-observed SST above the corresponding maximum of the monthly mean (MMM) climatology, measuring the magnitude of daily heat stress that can lead to coral bleaching. The MMM climatology for any given grid cell is the maximum value among the 12-monthly mean SST climatologies at the grid cell. DHW (expressed in the unit °C-weeks) accumulates all daily HotSpot values that are at least 1°C, over a 12-week period (84-days).

The statistical relationship derived from ground-based measurements of forest biomass density and collocated Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR waveform metrics, as described by Baccini et al. (2012), was used to estimate the biomass density of more than 40,000 GLAS footprints throughout the tropics. Then, using Random Forest models, the GLAS-derived estimates of biomass density were correlated to continuous, gridded variables, including Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite imagery and products (e.g., reflectance), elevation, and biophysical variables. By using continuous gridded data sets as inputs to the Random Forest models, a wall-to-wall 30 m resolution map of aboveground woody biomass density across the tropics was produced.

GISTEMP provides an estimate of global surface and air temperature changes. The basic GISS temperature analysis scheme was defined by James Hansen in the late 1970s, when a method of estimating global temperature change was needed for comparison with 1-dimensional global climate models. The scheme was based on the finding that the correlation of temperature change was reasonably strong for stations separated by up to 1,200 km, especially at middle and high latitudes. This fact proved sufficient to obtain useful estimates for global mean temperature changes. The analysis method was fully documented in Hansen and Lebedeff (1987), including quantitative estimates of the error in annual and 5-year mean temperature change. This was done by sampling at station locations a spatially complete data set of a long run of a global climate model, which was shown to have realistic spatial and temporal variability. This however only addresses the error due to incomplete spatial coverage of measurements. As there are other potential sources of error, such as urban warming near meteorological stations, many other methods have been used to verify the approximate magnitude of inferred global warming. These methods include inference of surface temperature change from vertical temperature profiles in the ground (bore holes) at many sites around the world, rate of glacier retreat at many locations, and studies by several groups of the effect of urban and other local human influences on the global temperature record. All of these yield consistent estimates of the approximate magnitude of global warming, which reached about 0.8°C in 2010, twice the magnitude reported in 1981. Further affirmation of the reality of the warming is its spatial distribution, which has largest values at locations remote from any local human influence, with a global pattern consistent with that expected for response to global climate forcings (larger in the Northern Hemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere, larger at high latitudes than low latitudes, larger over land than over ocean). More recent documentation compares alternative analyses and addresses questions about perception and reality of global warming; various choices for the ocean data are tested; it is also shown that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions, where observations are limited. A multiyear smoothing is applied to fully remove the annual cycle and improve information content in temperature graphs. Despite large year-to-year fluctuations associated with the El Niño-La Niña cycle of tropical ocean temperature, the conclusion could be drawn that global temperature continued to rise rapidly in the 21st century, new record heights being reached in every decade. One of the improvements—introduced in 1998—was the implementation of a method to address the problem of urban warming: The urban and periurban (i.e., other than rural) stations are adjusted so that their long-term trend matches that of the mean of neighboring rural stations. Urban stations without nearby rural stations are dropped. This preserves local short-term variability without affecting long-term trends. Originally, the classification of stations was based on population size near that station; the current analysis uses satellite-observed night-lights to determine which stations are located in urban and periurban areas.

Solar energy investors and project developers can use these data to identify regions of the world likely to have sufficient solar resources to make a solar generation facility a worthwhile investment. Vaisala is an industry leader in the solar resource assessment space. It has been at the forefront of research regarding the estimation of surface solar conditions to better understand and predict solar energy generation. In 2010, Vaisala produced the world's first high-resolution, globally consistent data set mapping the world's solar resource potential. The annual average GHI information from this data set is provided here at a 2 arc minute resolution and based on over a decade of half-hourly, high-resolution visible satellite imagery via the broadband visible wavelength channel. The values have been processed using a combination of peer-reviewed, industry-standard techniques and in-house, including a cloud-index algorithm that produces consistent results when used with the large number of satellites that must be combined to construct a global data set. Vaisala's complete global solar database includes 2 decades of hourly estimates of GHI, direct normal irradiance (DNI), and diffuse irradiance (DIF) and is regularly maintained and updated across 5 different versions of the data set. GHI is most relevant for fixed-panel PV installations, and DNI is most relevant for concentrated solar power (CSP) projects and PV tracking systems. This data set can be used for rapid prospecting for solar energy generation sites or conducting national or regional infrastructure, policy, or transmission planning. However, the development of specific utility-scale projects generally requires additional site-specific research after this step.

Together they produce a unified global cropland extent map at nominal 1 km resolution called the Global Cropland Extent, Version 1 (GCE V1.0). Developing an advanced global cropland area database (GCAD) with an ability to map global croplands and their attributes routinely, rapidly, consistently, and with sufficient accuracies helps determine how global croplands are used and how they might be better managed to optimize use of resources in food production. The process of aggregating the 4 global cropland products involved resampling each global cropland product to a common resolution of 1 km and then performing GIS data overlays to determine where the cropland extents mapped by these products match and where they differ. All 4 products have considerable uncertainties in determining the precise location of the croplands. The great degree of uncertainty in the cropland products can be attributed to factors such as coarse resolution, methods used, approaches adopted, and limitations of the data such as saturation. The 3 global cropland maps were produced by Thenkabail et al. (Thenkabail et al. 2009b; Biradar et al. 2009; Thenkabail et al. 2011; Pittman et al. 2010; Yu et al. 2013). A recent MODIS global land cover and land use map where croplands have also been mapped created by Friedl et al. (2010) was also used. Thenkabail et al.

These measures are modified to ensure they match with the country-level crop statistics of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). MapSPAM uses a 4-step modeling process: (1) start with administrative units for which crop production statistics are available; (2) obtain a classified land-cover image with cropland identified; (3) integrate crop-specific suitability information from the FAO Global Agro-ecological Zones (GAEZ); and (4) employ a cross-entropy approach to obtain estimates of crop distribution among viable crop areas. Data on administrative units and crop production come largely from the Mapping of Agricultural Production Systems (Agro-MAPS) project, World Food Programme (WFP) crop and food supply assessment mission surveys, national bureaus of statistics and other government ministries, regional agricultural centers and NGOs, and water resource groups, among others. Crop production systems are differentiated into 4 technologies: irrigated high inputs production (I), rain-fed high inputs production (H), rain-fed low inputs production (L), and rain-fed subsistence production (S). Data are also provided by a total for all technologies (A) and totals for all rain-fed technologies (R). These production system definitions are modeled after the FAO GAEZ. The proportion of crop areas using irrigated high-input production are taken directly from country statistics for China, the United States, and Brazil; other countries' data are drawn from the monthly irrigated and rain-fed crop areas (MIRCA) and FAO AQUASTAT irrigated areas databases. The extent of crop growing areas is derived from a compilation of satellite imagery from various sources, as well as detailed crop distribution maps at 5 arc minute scale where they are available.

The Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) equation incorporates these factors into a calculation of PET that is widely considered to be the best estimate of actual PET available: PET = 0.0023 * RA * (Tmean + 17.8) * TD^(0.5), where RA represents extraterrestrial radiation in millimeters per month, Tmean is the mean temperature in degrees Celsius, and TD is the daily temperature range in degrees Celsius. These variables are not always available at every point on Earth, which prevents calculation with the FAO-PM. This Global PET database is calculated using a simpler equation attributed to Hargreave, which requires monthly average data sets of mean temperatures, daily temperature range, and extraterrestrial radiation. These variables are all available in the WorldClim Global Climate Data database. Resource Watch shows only a subset of the data set.

VH products can be used as proxy data for monitoring vegetation health, drought, soil saturation, moisture and thermal conditions, fire risk, greenness of vegetation cover, vegetation fraction, leaf area index, start/end of the growing season, crop and pasture productivity, teleconnection with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), desertification, mosquito-borne diseases, invasive species, ecological resources, land degradation, etc. The VH indices range from 0 to 100 characterizing changes in vegetation conditions from extremely poor (0) to excellent (100). Fair conditions are coded by green color (50), which changes to brown and red when conditions deteriorate and to blue when they improve. The VH reflects indirectly a combination of chlorophyll and moisture content in the vegetation health and also changes in thermal conditions at the surface. Monitoring vegetation health (condition), including drought detection and watch, is based on radiance measurements in the visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and 10.3-11.3 micrometers thermal (T) bands (channels) of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). These measurements are processed to reduce long-term noise. The VIS and NIR values were converted to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI=(NIR-VIS)/(NIR+VIS)] and the T to brightness temperature (BT) using a look-up table. The NDVI and BT were filtered in order to eliminate high frequency noise. They were also adjusted for a non-uniformity of the land surface due to climate and ecosystem differences using multi-year NDVI and BT data.

Soil organic carbon stocks are important because they are correlated with the productive capacity of land to generate food and other plant life. Soil property estimates are generated using machine learning techniques that combine soil samples, expert opinion, and remote-sensing data. 150,000 soil profiles from a variety of reporting organizations are used in conjunction with a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps) to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods—random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression—as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56% (coarse fragments) and 83% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables.

Erosion and sedimentation by water involves the process of detachment, transport, and deposition of soil particles, driven by forces from raindrops and water flowing over the land surface. Because soil erosion is difficult to measure at large scales, soil erosion models are crucial estimation tools to extrapolate limited data to other localities and conditions. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), which predicts annual soil loss from rainfall and runoff, is the most common model used at large spatial scales due to its relatively simple structure and empirical basis. The model takes into account rainfall erosivity, topography, soil erodibility, land cover and management, and conservation practices. Because the RUSLE model was developed based on agricultural plot scale and parameterized for environmental conditions in the USA, modifications of the methods and data inputs are necessary to make the equation applicable to the globe. We estimated erosion potential based on the RUSLE model, adjusted to extend its applicability to a global scale. Conservation practices and topography information were not included in this model to calculate global erosion potential, due to data limitation and their relatively minor contribution to the variation in soil erosion at the continental to global scale compared to other factors.
